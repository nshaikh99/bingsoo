      "message": "The code coverage report generated by this code shows 0% coverage, which doesnâ€™t make sense since we have tests that should at least cover some of the code. I think that you may need to modify the include function in the line above the generate_coverage_report function to include additional files like the source code and the tests themselves so that the code coverage report knows what files to analyze for code coverage and what files to analyze against.",
